| 4        | 35.00       | This was a good deal, the typical price is inflated at £45 at the time of purchase                                                            | [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B - 2GB](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/404593051397?hash=item5e33a00705:g:HDIAAOSw-o9lQ6lb&amdata=enc%3AAQAIAAAAwHEosaBESy1JFxpl6PKudeJkcvaXN9vvMQMM%2BeJbMpz8Z%2BQ%2F6XclW16pArmxERKuTTImPDmMrBI7bfetDYy%2Fzr5s53CwR3tnMmyOsVZBURaW1UGHDkUMJJ3P8FzDG6jkHH6hrdZkKEACnJfCJGTC3XFLv1oyiLi%2FbJcYpa4P7h0G34NY%2FQcd%2FgzvtSk4RtIxjfmaCQT%2B1NnsZCHAmmlaTvbwf6hRYff8xGZNlRKj%2BgyqPHgOqnQvjvVWZUNAgEm55w%3D%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR9aLh52AYw)
| 4        | 18.40       | Off brand ones carry the risk of killing the PI :skull:, the newer PoE+ was expensive, and provided more power than necessary [^peo-hat-note] | [Raspberry Pi POE HAT Power Over Ethernet Revision3 3b+ 4b NEW rev3 UK Official](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/404458855152?hash=item5e2ba05af0%3Ag%3AGSkAAOSwlhtj57vd&amdata=enc%3AAQAIAAAA4NFRpjRWUSkAUGxXcuIhZlbSB8P1N3V7x5QS6bdriL0YHpY7H0rgtlLiEl9n1ycQomx0zlCWGOwvnJiqHHlG6c8kqDApLxM1UV4dkBy3cJmHN0TTT5ikASKMzRz5yl1q7E%2B6jEXClfHiPgyQkwftIF2cUOy7YpL22eN8rDqFF55iADHlnbvwVVVCb4gMfGPzqhckCQdGh%2FVS9gIrPeyzvjq8i2pTH%2BFMNX9WO4sidBXcAdItAR76v3IuOP19oyuyvwkdYFxWE1t4VAfTS2X4%2BWsPSIC3bDQajvjLozQYxhQ1%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR7bTsq-AYw&LH_BIN=1)
| 1        | 10.77       | Pack of 5, CAT7 is overkill, and cable is a little stiff                                                                                      | [Cat 7 0.3m ethernet cable (pack of 5)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07ZTR8HHH/ref=ox_sc_act_title_3?smid=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&psc=1)
| 1        | 30.00       | Bought instead of TP-Link PoE 40W [^tp-link-switch] switch as this delivers more watts in total, for cheaper                                  | [Tenda 5 port, 4PoE 63W buget](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tenda-Desktop-Overload-Protection-TEG1105P-4-63W-TEG1105P-4-63W-UK/dp/B09CYBMK51/ref=psdc_430573031_t1_B08D9G7WPN?th=1)
| 1        | 20.00       | Main concern was the Pi with the PoE hat won't fit, but it works fine.
